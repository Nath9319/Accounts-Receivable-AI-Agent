Absolutely! As your Senior Scrum Master for the Agentic AI transformation of these core accounting processes, my job is to ensure our backlog is clear, actionable, and prioritized—so our teams can deliver value fast and iteratively. Here’s how we’ll break down the work into **Epics, User Stories, and Tasks** for each workflow.

# 1. Clarifying Questions (Before Sprint Planning)

To maximize success, I need answers to these key questions:

1. **Data Inputs:** What are the primary sources/formats for data (e.g., ERP, PDFs, emails, scanned docs, spreadsheets) in each workflow?
2. **Systems Integration:** What accounting/HR/ERP systems are we integrating with (SAP, Oracle, Workday, QuickBooks, custom)?
3. **Rules & Policy Complexity:** Are business rules (e.g., approval matrix, coding logic, compliance policies) documented and configurable, or do they require discovery?
4. **Human Oversight:** Which steps require mandatory human review, and which can be fully automated?
5. **Volume & Frequency:** What is the average monthly volume for each process (e.g., invoices, payroll runs, expense reports)?
6. **Security & Compliance:** Any special compliance (SOX, GDPR, tax) or auditability requirements for agent actions?
7. **Prioritization:** Which process delivers the most value if automated first?
8. **Agent Platform:** Do we have a preferred AI agent framework (LangChain, AutoGen, RPA, custom) or is this open?
9. **Exception Handling:** How should exceptions or low-confidence cases be routed?

# 3. Next Steps

- **Please answer the clarifying questions above** so we can refine stories and tasks further.
- Once we have system/data details, we’ll break these stories into sprint-ready tasks, estimate, and prioritize.
- We’ll also define acceptance criteria for each story and set up our Kanban/Scrum board for tracking.
