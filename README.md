# Accounts-Receivable-AI-Agent
Accounts Receivable AI Agent - This project implements an automated Accounts Receivable (AR) workflow using LangGraph and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. The agent processes incoming sales orders, assesses customer creditworthiness against a defined company policy, and determines whether to approve, reject, or escalate the order for human review.
